# BriefvomHimmel
Produced by Yuki Soffd, it is a public practice work, and the code in it can be used freely without consent.

Some files could not be uploaded because they require more than 25MB of storage space. In addition, the pictures and audio files in this project should not be used freely, as you may not be authorized by the organizations that provided them.

This concludes the present presentation and there is nothing else to add.
